            We thought that there are some problems with the way the US government is currently set up, and we have some proposals to
            help fix it. While you may disagree with our proposed solutions, we hope that after viewing the data, you agree that there is a problem.
            Please keep these in mind the next time you discuss politics and especially when you vote!
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>The Senate favors small states.
                    So much so that this puts the Democratic party and its concentration of supporters
                    in large states at a massive disadvantage. </li>
                <li>However, this was intentional. That's why Congress is split between the House of Representatives and the Senate.
                Large states have the advantage in the House, small states have the advantage in the Senate. All legislation must pass both chambers as a compromise.</li>
                <li><em>So why does the House not get a say in confirming judicial (and other) appointments? Confirmations should pass both chambers just like legislation.</em></li>

                <br>
                <li>Judge Garland was deemed nominated too close to the election to be voted on. Judge Barrett was deemed nominated early enough to be confirmed.
                This is inconsistent. </li>
                <li><em>There needs to be an established legal definition of how close to the election a nominee can be voted on
                    that can be consistently applied. </em></li>
                <br>
                <li>The Senate is supposed to reject a nominee if they find the nominee unsuitable.
                Refusing to even consider the nominee is extremely unusual. </li>
                <li><em> If the Senate is unwilling to do its constitutional role of confirming or denying nominees within a reasonable time span,
                the nominee should be confirmed automatically to incentivize the Senate to act.</em></li>
                <br>
                <li>In President Obama's last term, the Republican controlled Senate confirmed an unprecedently small number of nominees,
                    leaving many judicial positions with life time terms open for President Trump to fill.</li>
                <li><em>There needs to be some way to better incentivize cross party cooperation.
                    That is a problem all across the country though, so we don't have a quick suggestion here.</em></li>
            </ul>
